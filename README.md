# Fallout Shelter: Project Safe House üèöÔ∏è

Fallout Shelter: Project Safe House is a Fallout fan game and aim to enhance the Fallout Shelter experience.
The idea is to completely remake the original game by improving, changing or adding features.

I won't be able to keep the project going for lack of time. But you can try to contribute to the project if you feel like it, or take a look at how it's work.
At the moment the game is just a very basic prototype of what it should look like.
